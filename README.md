# Adaptive Threat Detection & Response (Full NO-BAT package)

This is the full project: cross-platform threat detection with a polished Flask dashboard.
**Optional SAFE MODE:** firewall blocking exists but is disabled by default (AUTO_BLOCK=0).

Run (NO-BAT, Smart App Control friendly):
1. Ensure Python 3.9+ is installed.
2. Extract this repo to a folder.
3. Open PowerShell in that folder and run:
   py run_app.py
4. Open http://127.0.0.1:5000 and log in with credentials from src/auth_config.json
